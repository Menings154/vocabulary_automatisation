Initial idea:
Extract all notes in brown from kindle and look up the german translation.
After that, make index cards in cartigo.

The project has following steps:
- make screenshots of each word using pyautogu
- recognize the image as a word using opencv (is this possible?)
- look up german translation
- create index cards (is there an api?)


TODO:
-index cards centered
-perhaps better translator possible
-optimize waiting times
-use virtual screen
-let it run on the pi
