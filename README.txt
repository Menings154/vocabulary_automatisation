Initial idea:
Extract a¶ll notes in brown from kindle and look up the german translation.
After that, make index cards in cartigo.

The project has following steps:
- make screenshots of each word using pyautogu
- recognize the image as a word using opencv (is this possible?)
- look up german translation
Ã- create index cards (is there an api?)
